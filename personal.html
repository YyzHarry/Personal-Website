					<h1>Quotes</h1>

				<p>These are some of my favorite quotes. They've helped me get through some tough times.</p>

				<h2>How to be a Winner</h2>
				<p>Recently another essay by <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/">Prof. André DeHon</a>, <i><a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~andre/general/student_research_advice.html">How to be a Winner: Advice for students starting into research work</a></i>, also teaches me a lot.<br>
				<font color="red">Reading again and again when losing heart or your direction</font>.</p>

					<div class="blockcontent">
						<p><b>Losers</b> will stop the first time they run into something they don't know, cannot solve a problem, or encounter trouble slightly out of what they consider “their part” of the problem and then offer excuses for why they cannot make any progress.<br>
						<b>Winners</b> consider the whole problem theirs and look for paths around every hangup.<br>
						<b>Losers</b> make sure there is someone or something to blame for their lack of progress.<br>
						<b>Winners</b> find ways to make progress despite complications.<br>
						<b>Losers</b> know all the reasons it cannot be done.<br>
						<b>Winners</b> find a way to do it.</p>

				<h2>Grinding through Ph.D. Career</h2>
				<p>Thanks to <a href="http://pgbovine.net/">Prof. Philip Guo</a>'s book <i><a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf">The Ph.D. Grind</a></i>, I could have an overview of a Ph.D. “grinding” life. It really helps and makes me feel more determined to pursue a Ph.D. career.</p>
				<div class="infoblock">
					<div class="blockcontent">
						<p>So why would anyone spend six or more years doing a Ph.D. when they aren’t going to become professors? <br>
						Everyone has different motivations, but one possible answer is that a Ph.D. program provides a safe environment for certain types of people to <i>push themselves far beyond their mental limits and then emerge stronger as a result</i>.</p>
						<p>---- By <a href="http://pgbovine.net/">Philip Guo</a>, <i><a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf">The Ph.D. Grind</a></i>.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="infoblock">
					<div class="blockcontent">
						<p>So, <i>Was it fun?</i> <br />
						I’ll answer using another F-word: <i>It was fun at times, but more importantly, it was fulfilling.</i> Fun is often frivolous, ephemeral, and easy to obtain, but true fulfillment comes only after overcoming significant and meaningful challenges. Pursuing a Ph.D. has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I feel extremely lucky to have been given the opportunity to be creative during this time.</p>
