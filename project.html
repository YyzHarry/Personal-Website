Above are images of our own built UAV.
<br>
We are doing research on UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)-aided communication. By adding several written modules , we aim to realize new applications under new scenarios of wireless communication.
I assembled two UAVs with separated modules, adjusted their PID parameters by debugging motors’ outputs, and realized stable flying and loitering. Also, SITL on Linux was used to do UAV simulations.
<br>
The main method we use is that we divided whole room into several cubes, used the Sentinel cruise function to sense the Wi-Fi intensity of each cube and collected several sets of data timely.
And we used each cube’s statistical mean of RSS as the merit to rebuild the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum map of indoor circumstance.

We now try to use UAV, associated with Android phones, to sense the intensity of WiFi.
<br>
Then we use the collected datas to build the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum of indoor circumstance.

We are now using UAV-based sensors to study the distribution of AQI/PM2.5 in specific and normal scenarios.
A dynamic system is built consisting of an UAV and other sensors, and implemented real-time measurement.
<br>
Then we proposed a novel distribution models of AQI/PM2.5 to realize the precisely prediction of AQI/PM2.5 in a given area.
And we used the data we collected to train the models, and compared it with several existing models.
