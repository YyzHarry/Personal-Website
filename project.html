Above are images of our own built UAV.
<br>
We are doing research on UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)-aided communication. By adding several written modules , we aim to realize new applications under new scenarios of wireless communication.
I assembled two UAVs with separated modules, adjusted their PID parameters by debugging motors’ outputs, and realized stable flying and loitering. Also, SITL on Linux was used to do UAV simulations.
<br>
The main method we use is that we divided whole room into several cubes, used the Sentinel cruise function to sense the Wi-Fi intensity of each cube and collected several sets of data timely.
And we used each cube’s statistical mean of RSS as the merit to rebuild the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum map of indoor circumstance.

<p style="font-family:Georgia;">
We now try to use UAV, associated with Android phones, to sense the intensity of WiFi.
<br>
Then we use the collected datas to build the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum of indoor circumstance.

<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:15px;">
We are now using UAV-based sensors to study the distribution of AQI/PM2.5 in specific and normal scenarios.
A dynamic system is built consisting of an UAV and other sensors, and implemented real-time measurement.
<br>
Then we proposed a novel distribution model of AQI/PM2.5 to realize the precisely prediction of AQI/PM2.5 in a given area.
And we used the data we collected to train the models, and compared its accuracy with several existing models.

<p>
<b>Time: Sept. 2014 – Dec. 2014</b>
</p>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:15px;">
Mine Sweeper is a command-line game based on C++.
<br>
It has incorporated functions including the Mine Sweeping game, timer, adjustable game difficulty, a leaderboard, colored UI, etc.
</p>

<br>

<p>

<strong>2. Multi-band filter </strong>
</span>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Time: Oct. 2015 – Dec. 2015</b>
</p>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:15px;">
Designed a multi-band filter and realized it on a circuit board.
<br>
Innovatively used Active Filter to realize the function, with fewer components.
<br>
Realized two fixed bands (300~400, 2500~3000) and two changeable bands (1200~1600, 1700~2100) controlled by a switch.
</p>
