<p>These are my research projects. I'm now working in the <a href="http://wireless.pku.edu.cn/">Institute of Advanced Communications</a>, advised by <a href="http://wireless.pku.edu.cn/home/songly/index.html">Prof. Lingyang Song</a>.</p>
<h2>Optimal Trajectory Planning of Drones for 3D Mobile Sensing</h2>

<h2>Realtime Profiling of Fine-Grained 3D AQI Distribution using UAV Sensing</h2>
<p>Time: <i>Dec. 2016 - Jun. 2017</i></p>

<p>We used UAV-based sensors to study the distribution of AQI in specific and normal scenarios.
A dynamic system is built consisting of an UAV and other sensors, and implemented real-time measurement.</p>
<p>Then we proposed a novel distribution model, consists of a linear part using Gaussian Plume model, and a non-linear part using artificial neural networks (ANN), to realize the precisely prediction of AQI in a given fine-grained area.
We used the data we collected to train the models, and its accuracy has been proved to outperform other existing models.</p>
<p>Then based on the proposed model, we design the <i>adaptive monitoring algorithms</i> for UAV realtime measurement, named as <i>complete</i> monitoring and <i>selective</i> monitoring.
We focus on how to select only a few target cubes to represent the whole AQI distribution.
By analyzing the physical characteristic, an objective function is formed to choose a sub-optimal way for the UAV trajectory.
Experimental results have shown our proposal can effectively reduce the power consumption of whole system.</p>
<p>Up to now, our work has been <b>accepted</b> by <i><b>IEEE GLOBECOM 2017</b></i>, and submitted to <i><b>IEEE Internet of Things Journal</b></i>.</p>
<h2>3D Spectrum Map Reconstruction using UAV Sensing</h2>
<p>Time: <i>Aug. 2016 - Dec. 2016</i></p>

<p>Above are images of our own built UAV.</p>
<p>We are doing research on UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)-aided communication. By adding several written modules , we aim to realize new applications under new scenarios of wireless communication.
I assembled two UAVs with separated modules, adjusted their PID parameters by debugging motors’ outputs, and realized stable flying and loitering. Also, SITL on Linux was used to do UAV simulations.</p>
<p>The main method we use is that we divided whole room into several cubes, used the Sentinel cruise function to sense the Wi-Fi intensity of each cube and collected several sets of data timely.
And we used each cube’s statistical mean of RSS as the merit to rebuild the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum map of indoor circumstance.</p>
<p>We now try to use UAV, associated with Android phones, to sense the intensity of WiFi.
Then we use the collected datas to build the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum of indoor circumstance.</p>
