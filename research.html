<h1>Research</h1>

<p>These are my research projects. I'm now working in the <a href="http://wireless.pku.edu.cn/">Institute of Advanced Communications</a>, advised by <a href="http://wireless.pku.edu.cn/home/songly/index.html">Prof. Lingyang Song</a>.</p>
<h2>3D Spectrum Map Building using Mobile Sensing</h2>

<p>Above are images of our own built UAV.</p>
<p>We are doing research on UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)-aided communication. By adding several written modules , we aim to realize new applications under new scenarios of wireless communication.
I assembled two UAVs with separated modules, adjusted their PID parameters by debugging motors’ outputs, and realized stable flying and loitering. Also, SITL on Linux was used to do UAV simulations.</p>
<p>The main method we use is that we divided whole room into several cubes, used the Sentinel cruise function to sense the Wi-Fi intensity of each cube and collected several sets of data timely.
And we used each cube’s statistical mean of RSS as the merit to rebuild the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum map of indoor circumstance.</p>
<p>We now try to use UAV, associated with Android phones, to sense the intensity of WiFi.
Then we use the collected datas to build the 3D Wi-Fi Spectrum of indoor circumstance.</p>
<h2>Fine-grained 3D Realtime AQI Monitoring by UAV</h2>

<p>We used UAV-based sensors to study the distribution of AQI in specific and normal scenarios.
A dynamic system is built consisting of an UAV and other sensors, and implemented real-time measurement.</p>
<p>Then we proposed a novel distribution model of AQI to realize the precisely prediction of AQI in a given fine-grained area.
The model we use is mainly based on a physical model which can precisely reflect the movements of particles.
We used the data we collected to train the models, and compared its accuracy with several existing models.</p>
<p>Then based on the proposed model, we design  <i>adaptive monitoring techniques</i> for UAV realtime measurement, named as <i>complete</i> monitoring and <i>optimized</i> monitoring.
Experimental results have shown our proposal can effectively reduce the power consumption of whole system.</p>
<p>Up to now, our work has been submitted to <i><b>IEEE GLOBECOM</b></i> and <i><b>ACM Mobicom</b></i>.</p>
<p>I'm now working on improving the model's estimation accuracy, by adding a non-linear part implemented by <b>Neural Networks</b>. Also, optimization problems are formed to choose optimal ways for UAV trajectory.</p>
