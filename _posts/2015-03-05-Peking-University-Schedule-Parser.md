## Introduction

Schedule Parser is a simple Python program, which reads HTML file of class schedule table from elective.pku.edu.cn and encodes .ics file,
making it simple to import class schedule into Apple Calendar, Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, etc.

## Web Service

To make it easy to use, I built a web interface and host it on my server at [cp.yangl1996.com](http://cp.yangl1996.com)
