This project is a paid work for Peking University Challenge Cup research contest. It simplifies contest workflow by providing a central place for collecting, reviewing and judging student work, plus a simple blog for contest updates. This project was carried out with help from [Jueast](http://jueast.com).

Designed with general purpose in mind, Innovator could be used in any contest/program with such workflow:

* Student enters the program by submitting a work and filling some information
* Event organizer assigns student works to judges
* Judges score works and may also leave some comments/feedbacks
* Organizer chooses prizes according to the average score of a work

The project is based on Flask, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap, with a complete test suite and aided by continuous integration during the development. Contribution in any form is greatly appreciated!
