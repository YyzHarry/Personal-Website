This is a little project I started during Google Summer of Code 2015, encouraged by Pierre-Yves Chibon. Now it is maintained by some [great contributors](https://github.com/yangl1996/libpagure/graphs/contributors).

The library works with [Pagure](https://pagure.io) and its web apis. If you have got some new feature or fixed some bugs, just send a pull request on the repository on [Pagure](https://pagure.io/libpagure). Thank you very much!

There is also a mirror on [GitHub](https://github.com/yangl1996/libpagure), but new changes will be pushed to Pagure and synced manually to GitHub after some time.

## Installation

The library is published on PyPI.

### Linux

```
pip3 install libpagure
```

### OS X

```
python3 -m pip install libpagure
```

## Usage

Please refer to [Pagure API Reference](https://pagure.io/api/0/). A detailed guide is on the way :)
