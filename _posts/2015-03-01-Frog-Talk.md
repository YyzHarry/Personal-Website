Frog Talk is carried out by [Jueast](http://jueast.com) and me. The project contains a server program and a very lightweight GUI client,
all written in Python3. It enables multiple people to talk with each other with funny names and have fun. Deploying a server is as easy as running
a Python script. We are improving the project and plan to add useful functions to the project, such as avatar, encrypted data transfer and etc.
