introduction: Squirrel is a lightweight file sharing tool I wrote for my own needs in Peking University Cluster Competition Team.

Our cluster competition team holds discussions regularly, and I want to make the discussion slides available to all team
members, while keeping it protected from the public. However, all existing file sharing tools are way too heavy for my
simple needs. So I decided to write one.

When building the tool, I follow these principals:

- Lightweight -- provide no fancy functions but just the very basic ones
- Simple to use -- users can get things done within several clicks or taps
- Fast to deploy -- just grab the code, do few essential configurations and rock'n'roll
- Fit in my workflow -- easy to upload files and to maintain the site

I wrote the app with Node.js, now I've completed a basic version and it's been put into use in our cluster
competition team. It syncs with a GitHub private repository. New files is committed into the repository with JSON format commit message. Squirrel then automatically pulls new files and extract file metadata from commit message, thus achieving simple workflow.
