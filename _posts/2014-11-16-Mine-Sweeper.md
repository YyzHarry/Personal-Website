It is a simple game. The program generates random mine distribution and the player should find out all
the mines using the given hints. If he makes an error and steps on a mine, the game is over.

This is an assignment of my curriculum *Introduction to Computation* in my freshman year.

Main functions include:

* the Mine Sweeping game
* Game archive
* timer
* control using array keys
* a menu
* adjustable game difficulty
* a leaderboard
* colored UI
