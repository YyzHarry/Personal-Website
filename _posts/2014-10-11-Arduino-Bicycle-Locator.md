## Introduction

We are building an Arduino project intended to solve the problem of finding a parked bike. Sometimes we park the bike and forget where we parked it. It can be even more frustrating when the bike is urgently needed.

With a simple device featuring a GPS receiver and a GSM module, we can remotely get the location of the bike via Internet. The user interface can be various, including mobile app, web app and text message.

Currently we are building the prototype using Arduino and some compatible shields.

This project is being carried out by yangl1996 and Ziniu Hu.

## Roadmap

First we want to build a prototype sending data via text message. After achieving this, we are improving the device and use the celluar network to send data. Meanwhile we are going to build a server-side application and a mobile app, making the data more accessible and user friendly.

Other features under consideration include a beeper for users to find their very bike in a crowd of bikes. Plus an anti-theft feature that locks the bike upon remote request.
